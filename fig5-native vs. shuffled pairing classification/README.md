This pair classification task was introduced in [Ng and Briney 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2025.101239).

The fine-tuning script `02_pair_classification-5itr.py` can be run with its associated config file (`pair-class_train-config.yaml`) using DeepSpeed, as described [here](https://github.com/brineylab/deepspeed/tree/main).
